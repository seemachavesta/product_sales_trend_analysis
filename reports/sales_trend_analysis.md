# Olist E-Commerce Sales Trend Analysis

This project analyzes sales performance, order volume trends, and category-level behavior using the Brazilian Olist e-commerce dataset.  
The goal is to identify high- and low-performing periods, understand product category patterns, and provide insights that can help optimize inventory and business strategy.

## 1. Monthly Sales Insights

- The lowest sales occurred in **2016-09**, with only **134.97**, which makes sense because the dataset begins partway through 2016.
- Sales increased steadily throughout 2017, showing strong growth from **2017-01 to 2017-11**.
- The highest sales occurred in **2017-11**, reaching **987,765.37**, the peak month in the entire dataset.
- A noticeable decline happened after **2017-11**, indicating a slowdown in late 2017 and through early 2018.

## 2. Monthly Order Volume Insights

- Order volume was lowest in **2016-09**, with only **1 order**, because the dataset starts mid-year.
- Orders grew rapidly from **2017-01 to 2017-11**, following almost the same growth pattern as sales.
- The peak order volume occurred in **2017-11**, with **7,289 orders**, matching the highest revenue month.
- Order trends closely mirror sales trends, suggesting that revenue growth was primarily driven by increasing order volume rather than changes in average order value.


## 3. Category-Level Insights

### Top-Selling Categories
The highest revenue came from the following categories:

1. **beleza_saude**  
2. **cama_mesa_banho**  
3. **esporte_lazer**  
4. **informatica_acessorios**  
5. **relogios_presentes**

These categories consistently drove the majority of total sales across the entire period.

### Category Growth Patterns
- Most top categories showed strong growth throughout **2017**, peaking around **November 2017**, similar to the overall sales trend.
- **beleza_saude** and **relogios_presentes** demonstrated the strongest sustained growth over time.
- A decline was visible across all categories after late 2017, indicating a broader slowdown in the platform rather than category-specific issues.

---

### Seasonal Peaks and Lows
Each top category exhibited different seasonal patterns:

- **beleza_saude** peaked in **2017-11**, aligning with the highest total sales and orders.  
- **cama_mesa_banho** also peaked in late 2017, reflecting high demand during the holiday season.  
- **esporte_lazer** saw increased demand during mid-to-late 2017, likely tied to seasonal or lifestyle trends.  
- All categories had their lowest sales during **late 2016**, which is expected because the dataset began mid-year and had limited order activity.
